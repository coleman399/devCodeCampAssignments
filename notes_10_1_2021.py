#String Interpilation + Rather than using the '+' symbol to concatenate two strings, we can use string interpolation, specifically called literal string interpolation utilizing a literal prefix 'f'
#To do this, use the literal prefix 'f' to restore the value of string variables inside the braces{}
#Sting Concatenation- the process of combining strings together.
#numbers- int and float; int, or integer, is a whole numvber of unlimited length without decimals, can be a positive or negative number. floats are decimals
#boolean = true or false
#arithmetic operatiors; + Addition, - subtraction, * multiplation, / divison, % modulus remainder after division, ++ increment = +1 always, -- decrement = -1 always
#Order of operations PEMDAS from left to right. Parenteses, Exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
#assignment operators; =, += (x=x+y;), -= (x=x-y), *= (x*y), /= (x=x/y;), %= (x=x%y;)
#comparison operatiors; == equal to, != doesn't equal, > greater than, < less than, >= greater than or equal to, <= less than or equal to

#if ALL individual expressions are true, the entire expression is true. AND; if any of the individual expressions are true, the entire expression is true, OR; not logical operator, flips boolean.
