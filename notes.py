# The range() function loops through a set of statements a specified number of times. Indexs start at 0. break statement are used to stop the loop earily. countine statements. we can stop the current iteration 
# of the loop and continue with the next iteration. while loop, excute as long as true. for loop, excute blocks of code for a specific amount of time. functions - name, parameters, and keyword. parameters 
# a scoped to the function. return - how we get value out of a function. a function doesn't need to have a return. only use return if you require a result from the function. parameters are how we provide
# "outside" data into the function. Calling a function means executing the code indented inside and putting it to use. The parameter is what is declared in the function
# while an argument is what is passed through when calling the function. After function is excuted the program will go back to the postion it was called. returned fuctions must be captured or value will be losted.
# fuctions do not require parameters to be excuted. these functions are called void functions. def function(variable, variable). a module is a file containing a set of functions that can be imported into
# file. any action a program takes is a function. from import, can imported function without referencing module name. Debugging, read from the bottom, place a breakpoint before the line that you suspect is breaking the program. 
# Debugging Operations; 1 StepInto- step into the excuting line or line in next function call

# pop function (method) = will 'pop' off the last element in the list and return it. When popping a value, you can capture the value being popped off from the list to the left of the pop function call
# Can also provide an index position to specify what value will be popped out of the list rather than using the default behavior of removing the last element. Remove method does not return an index. 
# Remove function (method) when you doen't know the position of the element you want to remove. The remove function (method)  will search through the list and find the first match and remove it 
# (does not return removed element) Remove will only delete the first value match it finds, it will not delete duplcates. 

# new_list = list.pop(1)
# new_list.remove('elementInList')
# commit = when where and why?
